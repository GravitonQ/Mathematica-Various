#Computational implications of the third law of Thermodynamics on elementary cellular automata
##By Gianmarco Morbelli

The Third Law of Thermodynamics asserts the impossibility to reduce the entropy
of a system to its absolute-zero value in a finite number of steps.
The aim of this project is to investigate how the third law can be understood within
the category of computational programs such as cellular automata. Simple
computational experiments on cellular automata are set up such that
perturbations, defined as changing the color of a set of cells at certain steps in the
iteration, are applied during the evolution of the system.
The goal is to achieve, with the least amount of perturbations, a final state
consisting of cells all of the same colour (“Local consensus”), as they neatly
correspond to states of minimum entropy, thus capturing the essence of the Third
Law. It is argued that the principle of computational irreducibility prevents us from
knowing a priori which conditions lead to a decrease in entropy. Thus, the loss of
information about which steps to perform to reach a zero entropy state is
conjectured to be what we perceive as the Third Law of Thermodynamics.
Possible future path of investigation may be to carry over this procedures to higher
dimensional cellular automata and to more general systems such as hypergraph
rewriting.
